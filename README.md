# My Junior Frontend Developer CV

This repository contains the HTML code for my personal Junior Frontend Developer CV. All styling (CSS) is embedded directly within the HTML file, making it a single, self-contained document. It's designed to be clean, easy to read, and based on a professional template.

## Features

* **Self-Contained:** All content and styling are in one `index.html` file.
* **Clean and Modern Design:** A straightforward layout that's easy on the eyes.
* **HTML Structure:** Semantic HTML5 for a well-organized and accessible document.
* **Embedded CSS:** Styling is applied directly within the HTML document using `<style>` tags, mimicking the provided template's look and feel.
* **Easy to Customize:** All content is directly in the HTML file, making it simple to update with your own information.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the CV.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout, embedded directly in the HTML.

## How to Use

To view and customize this CV:

1.  **Download the `index.html` file** directly to your computer.
2.  **Open `index.html`** in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  **Edit `index.html`:** Open the `index.html` file in a text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++).
    * **Replace all placeholder text** (e.g., "Company Name, Location - Job Title", "List of achievements") with your actual professional details.
    * **Update contact information**, skills, education, and experience sections.
    * **Ensure your LinkedIn and GitHub profile links** in the "Across the Internet" section are correct.
    * If you wish to change the visual appearance (colors, fonts, spacing), you will need to edit the CSS code located within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of the `index.html` file.
